Use OpenWRT's wireless connection state as MQTT device trackers
ref: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_tracker.mqtt/

Inspired largely by [dersimn/owrtwifi2mqtt](https://github.com/dersimn/owrtwifi2mqtt),
but since that requires a lot of YAML config, and I don't like that it works on IP instead of MAC.

I also figure it's likely less resource intensive if it's not checking the IP,
hostname, or any other info every time.

All this needs to do is:
* read a small amount of config (from uci?) for what MQTT server to talk to and what zone to update
* read config (from uci? or mqtt?) for a list of MACs to monitor
* send some basic discovery info on startup for the configured MACs
  This discovery info **could** include device name and such,
  but at most that should be set in the config beforehand.
  NOTE: Don't set node_id AP-specific because that would cause issues for a device_tracker across multiple APs at once
  NOTE: Maybe the discovery info is the config?
* send home/away/zone updates to the specific MAC topics
* set the topic state to "offline" when not running
  How does mqtt "last will" work?


The "zone" state is optional, but would be useful for running this for another building over the VPN.
