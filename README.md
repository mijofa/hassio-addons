# Almostserious `HASS.IO` Repository
Hey!
This is my Home Assistant's _Supervisor_ add-ons repository.

Based on pla10 ("which was based on Raph2i with some smaller changes"),
with the add-ons I don't intend to use removed.
All Addons compile on your machine at installation, let it work.


Personal dev notes
------------------
The version number in config.yaml is a little picky,
I tried doing "myversion:upstreamversion" like "0.0.1:v1.27.0",
and the hasio server wouldn't build them.
